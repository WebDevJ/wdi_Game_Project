# Project #1: "Zombie FACE"

### Summary

Welcome to the end of the world...
**Zombie Face** is a point and click shooter were you as a player can survive the round and earn cash by killing zombies. Each player has a chance to prepare them selfs for the wave of attacking zombies. While in the round you must point and click a zombie to kill it BUT be aware these zombies are like "CRAZY 28DAYS Later" creatures, they do not stay still or move slow. You must kill them before they disappear or you are doomed.

**Good Luck**
